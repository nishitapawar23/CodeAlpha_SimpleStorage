# CodeAlpha Blockchain Internship Tasks

## About
This repository contains tasks completed during my blockchain internship, implemented using Solidity smart contracts.

## Task 1 — Simple Storage Smart Contract
Description: Implemented a Solidity smart contract that stores an integer value and provides functions to increment and decrement the value securely.  
Tech: Solidity, Remix IDE

## Task 2 — MultiSend Smart Contract
Description: Developed a smart contract that distributes Ether evenly to multiple wallet addresses in a single transaction.  
Tech: Solidity, Remix IDE

## Task 3 — Crypto Locking Smart Contract
Description: Built a smart contract that allows users to deposit Ether with a specified lock time and withdraw funds only after the lock period expires.  
Tech: Solidity, Remix IDE

## How to Test
1. Open Remix IDE
2. Compile the smart contract files
3. Deploy the contracts
4. Interact with the contract functions using Remix

## Tech Stack
- Solidity
- Remix IDE

## Key Learnings
- Smart contract development and deployment
- Ethereum blockchain fundamentals
- Solidity syntax and contract logic
- Hands-on testing using Remix IDE
